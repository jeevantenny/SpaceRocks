# SpaceRocks (A Game inspired by Asteroids)
**version 0.4.1**  
*python-3.13.3*

I made this game to test out a new framework I made for any games I would want to make in the future using pygame. It takes a inspiration from Atari's Asteroids Arcade Game. You control a spaceship that can turn move forward and shoot and you shoot asteroids to gain points.

## Features
- Infinitely scrolling world in all directions
- Soundfx volume scale with distance.
- Press **F11** to toggle fullscreen mode
- Support for select number of controllers
- Progress is not lost when application is closed. Player can continue from exactly where they left off.
- **Ctrl D** to toggle debug mode (for testing)

## Controls
### Keyboard
- **W** to move forward
- **A**-**D** to turn
- **SPACE** to shoot

### Controller
- **Right Trigger**/**Bumper** to move forward
- **Left Stick**/**D-pad** to turn
- **A** to shoot
